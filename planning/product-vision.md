# Product Vision – HealthApp

## Problem Statement
Many university students neglect preventive healthcare due to academic workload and lack of awareness. Minor health indicators such as poor sleep patterns, high blood pressure, or irregular exercise habits are often ignored until serious conditions develop.

## Target Users
Primary Users:
- University students

Secondary Users:
- Campus clinic staff
- System administrators

## Proposed Solution
HealthApp is a preventive healthcare monitoring system that allows students to:
- Record basic health indicators
- View health summaries
- Receive preventive health reminders
- Book campus clinic appointments

The system does not diagnose medical conditions but promotes early awareness and encourages timely medical consultation.

## Alignment with SDG 3
This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by encouraging preventive healthcare practices and early detection awareness among young adults.

## Value Proposition
HealthApp provides a simple and accessible platform that empowers students to take proactive steps in monitoring their health and seeking professional support when necessary.
