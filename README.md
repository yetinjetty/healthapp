## Project Overview
HealthApp is a preventive healthcare monitoring system designed to promote early detection and preventive health practices among university students.
The application allows students to record basic health indicators, receive preventive health reminders, and book campus clinic appointments.
The system supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by encouraging proactive health monitoring and timely medical consultation.

---

## Project Objectives
- Promote preventive healthcare awareness among university students
- Encourage early detection of potential health risks
- Provide a simple and accessible health monitoring platform
- Support timely medical consultation through appointment booking

---

## Problem Statement
Many university students neglect preventive healthcare due to academic workload and a lack of awareness.
Minor health indicators such as poor sleep patterns, high blood pressure, or irregular exercise habits are often ignored until serious conditions develop.

There is a need for a simple digital platform that promotes early awareness and encourages students to take preventive action.
